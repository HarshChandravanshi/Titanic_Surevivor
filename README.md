In conclusion, our analysis using pandas and numpy reveals some interesting patterns regarding the survival rates of Titanic passengers. Firstly, it became evident that female passengers were given priority over men when it came to rescue efforts. This act of chivalry and protection showcased the prevailing societal norms of the time.

Furthermore, the survival rate was found to be higher among passengers belonging to higher social classes or those who were financially well-off. This observation suggests that the hierarchy on board might have played a role in the prioritization of rescue efforts, potentially favoring the wealthy individuals.
